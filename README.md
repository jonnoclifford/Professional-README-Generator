# Module 11 Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

Write a command-line application to generate a professional quality README from user input using the Inquirer package.

The README must include the following sections:

* Title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions

### Tasks completed

* When 'node index.js' is run in terminal the application will display prompts to fill in the sections above one by one.

* The application will also generate a table of contents, which, when a section item is clicked on, will take you to that section.

* When the user selects a license, this is displayed with the corresponding badge for that license.

* Once all information has been input, the final step will generate the README with this information, saving it in the root folder.
